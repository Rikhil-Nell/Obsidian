#### **1. Data Ingestion** (Unstructured Data Upload)

- **Input**: User uploads their company's unstructured data (e.g., financial reports, sustainability initiatives, CSR documents, etc.).
- **Functionality**: Parse and extract key sections using **NLP** techniques (Named Entity Recognition, keyword extraction, etc.) to identify relevant ESG-related content.
    - Focus areas: **Environmental (E)**, **Social (S)**, and **Governance (G)**.

#### **2. ESG Mapping to the GRI Framework**

- **Framework Choice**: Use the **GRI Standards** for categorizing and scoring. GRI is widely used and recognized, making it a good starting point.
    - Categories include:
        - **Environmental**: Resource consumption, energy use, waste management, carbon emissions.
        - **Social**: Employee well-being, labor practices, community impact.
        - **Governance**: Business ethics, board structure, transparency.
- **Tagging System**:
    - NLP models classify the data into the appropriate **GRI categories**.
    - The AI system identifies **relevant sections** from the user's reports and **auto-tags** them under GRI-based ESG categories.

#### **3. ESG Scoring**

- **Score Calculation**:
    - Assign a **weighted score** to each GRI category based on the content’s compliance with key performance indicators (KPIs) of the GRI framework.
    - Example: The more aligned the environmental data is to GRI’s standards (e.g., carbon emissions reporting), the higher the score.
    - Provide an overall **ESG score** for the company, segmented into E, S, and G scores.
- **Visualization**: Present this score in a **dashboard** with easy-to-understand **charts** and **progress bars** to show strengths and weaknesses in each ESG category.

#### **4. Recommendations Based on GRI Framework**

- **Suggestion Engine**:
    - After generating the score, the AI provides **suggestions** for improvements, linked directly to **specific GRI guidelines**.
    - Example: If the company scores poorly in “water usage,” suggest practices like **better water recycling** or **efficient irrigation** as recommended by GRI.
    - Highlight which areas of the report **comply** and which **need improvement**.

#### **5. RAG System for Interactive Queries (Optional for Hackathon)**

- **Retrieve ESG Documentation Insights**:
    - If you want to include **RAG**, you could let users ask specific questions about their report based on **GRI documentation**.
        
    - Users could upload their reports and ask queries like:
        
        - "Which parts of my report align with GRI environmental standards?"
        - "How does my energy usage comply with GRI guidelines?"
    - The **RAG model** retrieves relevant sections from **GRI guidelines** and provides **contextual answers**.
        
    - This feature can be **implemented post-hackathon** to avoid overcomplication during initial development.
        

#### **6. ESG Report Generation**

- **Output**:
    - After processing the data and scoring, the system generates a **comprehensive ESG report**.
    - The report would:
        - Detail the company’s alignment with **GRI categories**.
        - Provide **suggestions** for improvements.
        - Summarize the company’s overall **ESG impact**.
- **Export Options**: Allow users to export the report as a **PDF** or **share** it with stakeholders.

### **Hackathon-Focused Features**

To make your pipeline hackathon-ready and avoid overcomplicating, focus on:

- **One ESG framework** (GRI) for categorization and scoring.
- **NLP-based tagging** for ESG data extraction.
- **Score generation and simple visualizations** to showcase the company's ESG performance.
- **Actionable suggestions** based on the GRI framework.

You can add the **RAG-based ESG framework interaction** later as a more advanced feature.

### **Tools and Libraries to Use**

- **NLP/Tagging**: SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers (for tagging and classification).
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy.
- **RAG Implementation**: Hugging Face Transformers for retrieval-augmented generation (optional for later).
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, or Dash (for ESG score charts).
- **Report Generation**: FPDF or WeasyPrint for PDF exports.
