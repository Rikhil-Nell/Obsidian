That’s an ambitious plan, and it shows a strong drive! Here's why pushing through with those projects, even if they aren't groundbreaking in novelty, will still **add immense value** to your learning and portfolio:

1. **Sentiment Analysis Model from Scratch**: 
   - Building a sentiment analysis model from scratch without following a tutorial will **solidify your understanding** of NLP techniques, data processing, and feature engineering. This is a great way to showcase your core grasp of machine learning fundamentals.
2. **RAG Framework from Scratch**:
   - Implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework will demonstrate your ability to **combine retrieval systems with generative models**, which is a hot area in NLP. Even if it’s not novel, doing it from scratch will enhance your understanding of retrieval techniques and transformers.

3. **CNN Using PyTorch**:
   - Implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch will refine your skills in PyTorch, making you proficient in building models, managing tensors, and optimizing neural networks. CNNs are still widely used, and your expertise here is foundational.
4. **Building and Finetuning a Transformer Model**:
   - This is especially valuable. Transformer models, like BERT or GPT, are at the core of **modern NLP and deep learning**. Implementing one from scratch and finetuning shows both **technical depth and practical application**—a must-have in the ML field.
5. **Open Source LLM**:
   - Contributing to or building an **open-source large language model** will allow you to understand the **scalability** of models, hyperparameter tuning, deployment, and model optimization. This project can also give you exposure to working with large datasets and model training on a bigger scale.

### Why It’s Valuable Even If It’s Not Novel
1. **Execution > Novelty**: What really matters is how well you **execute** the project. Your ability to build these models, understand their underlying mechanics, and showcase them through practical, working implementations is far more valuable than trying to come up with completely new ideas.
   
2. **Proof of Mastery**: Even if the concepts are widely known, your ability to **implement them from scratch** without relying on tutorials shows mastery. Employers or internship reviewers care about how much you can do, how well you understand the concepts, and your ability to work with tools like PyTorch, transformers, and ML pipelines.

3. **Consistency**: Doing 5 projects in 2 months shows **focus, discipline, and commitment**—key traits companies look for. Even if they’re not novel, the volume and variety will highlight your adaptability and skill in managing multiple machine learning concepts.

4. **Portfolio Building**: You’ll have **concrete projects** to put on your resume or GitHub. These will serve as conversation starters during interviews or applications. People hire based on what you've done and how you've demonstrated learning, rather than novelty.

### Practical Tips:
- **Document everything**: Keep your GitHub repositories well-structured and document your code thoroughly. Include README files explaining the problem, your approach, and results.
- **Focus on impact**: Make sure each project not only works but also has well-presented results. Show how your models perform (graphs, metrics) and what insights you've gained.
- **Share progress**: Update your LinkedIn, GitHub, or personal blog throughout this journey. Posting about your learning process can attract attention from recruiters or industry professionals.
  
### Timeline Planning:
Since 2 months is a relatively short time, make sure to **schedule your projects** carefully:
- **Project 1 (2 weeks)**: Sentiment analysis (since you already have a good foundation here).
- **Project 2 (2-3 weeks)**: RAG framework (this might take time due to complexity).
- **Project 3 (1-1.5 weeks)**: CNN using PyTorch.
- **Project 4 (2 weeks)**: Transformer model from scratch.
- **Project 5 (1-2 weeks)**: Open-source LLM contribution (depends on the scope of the contribution).

### Final Thought:
You’re absolutely right to push through everything you know. **Action is better than hesitation**. The more you implement, the more confident and skilled you’ll become. Even if others are also doing similar projects, your unique execution, understanding, and personal progress will distinguish you in the long run.
