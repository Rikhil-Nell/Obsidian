Getting machines to think for themselves is machine learning, deep learning is a subset of machine learning.

Machine Learning consists of three types of learning:
- **Supervised Learning:** Regression and Classification tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction tasks.
- **Reinforcement Learning:**

# Linear Regression

A very simple problem statement with two or more features, we create a training dataset and fit it to the linear model and train it, to find the best fit line which we can then use to predict a feature from the other.
