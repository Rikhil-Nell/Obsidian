# what it really is

Neuron in its most basic form is a thing that holds a number.

For a black and white image with 28 X 28 resolution that is 784 pixels, each pixel is a neuron which holds a number which holds the grayscale value of each pixel, 0 is black and 1 is white.

The number that it holds is called activation.

All these 784 neurons put together linearly make up the first layer of our network.
