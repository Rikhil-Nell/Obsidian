**Adverbs Overview:** Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire sentences. They often end in -ly but not always. Examples include: really, very, well, badly, today, sometimes, early, here, and everywhere.

**Types of Adverbs:**

1. **Manner:** Describe how an action is performed (e.g., quickly, slowly).
    - _Example:_ She sings beautifully.
2. **Time:** Indicate when an action occurs (e.g., now, later).
    - _Example:_ We will leave soon.
3. **Place:** Indicate where an action occurs (e.g., here, there).
    - _Example:_ He looked everywhere for his keys.
4. **Frequency:**  
    - _Example:_ She always forgets her keys.
5. **Degree:** Indicate the intensity or degree (e.g., very, quite).
    - _Example:_ The water is very cold.
6. **Reason:** Explain why something happens (e.g., therefore, hence).
    - _Example:_ She was tired; therefore, she went to bed early.


**Adverbs Modifying Verbs:** Adverbs describe how an action occurs, answering questions like how, when, where, or with what frequency.

- _Example:_ Huan sings loudly.

**Linking Verbs and Adverbs:** Linking verbs (e.g., feel, smell) usually precede adjectives, not adverbs.

- _Correct:_ Paz feels bad.

**Adverbs Modifying Adjectives:** Adverbs can intensify or qualify adjectives.

- _Example:_ The lake is quite beautiful.

**Adverbs Modifying Other Adverbs:** Adverbs can describe other adverbs to add intensity.

- _Example:_ The weather report is almost always right.

**Sentence Adverbs:** These adverbs modify whole sentences, conveying a general feeling.

- _Example:_ Fortunately, we got there in time.

**Degrees of Comparison:** Adverbs can show comparison.

- _Positive:_ He smiled warmly.
- _Comparative:_ He smiled more warmly.
- _Superlative:_ He smiled most warmly.

**Placement of Adverbs:** Adverbs should be placed close to the words they modify to avoid confusion.

- _Correct:_ I almost dropped all the papers.

**Avoiding Superfluous Adverbs:** While useful, adverbs should not be overused. Stronger verbs or adjectives often make writing more vivid.

- _Example:_ Instead of "The board forcefully took control away," use "The board wrested control."

**Key Takeaways:**

- Use adverbs to modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or sentences.
- Be careful with linking verbs and adverbs.
- Place adverbs close to what they modify.
- Avoid unnecessary adverbs by choosing stronger verbs and adjectives.
