**Artificial Intelligence:** The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

AI doesn't need to be super complex, in the olden days AI was a simple program iterating over a predefined set of rules to simulate human-like behavior.

**Machine learning** is the first stride in technology where, rather than the computer giving answers when given data and rules, it gives us rules when given data and answers.

Due to the nature of ML models it is not necessarily 100% accurate and hence our goal is to make the model as accurate as possible.

**Neural Networks**: A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.
- **Features** are the input given to the model to predict the **Label** which is the unknown value.

# Different types of machine learning

## Supervised learning

In this form of learning, we supervise the **Label** generated by the program with its existing rules and tweak it a little bit to make it more accurate to the **Label** we have from the input.

## Unsupervised learning

In this form of learning we only have **Features**, given a bunch of **features** and no **labels** we ask the model to come up with a model.

## Reinforcement learning

This is a very different way of learning, we have an **agent** who is to iterate over an **environment** to complete the designated task for every step taken in correct direction it is given a **reward** and for every step in wrong direction **reward** is taken away.
