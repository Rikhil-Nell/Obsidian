Energy is a concept used throughout chemistry to discuss molecular structures, reactions, and many other processes.

The transformation of energy from one form to another is described by the laws of **thermodynamics** They are applicable to bulk matter, which consists of very large numbers of atoms and molecules. The ‘First Law’ of thermodynamics is a statement about the quantity of energy involved in a transformation; the ‘Second Law’ is a statement about the dispersal of that energy.

To discuss the energy of individual atoms and molecules that make up samples of bulk matter it is necessary to use **quantum mechanics** According to this theory, the energy associated with the motion of a particle is **‘quantized’**, meaning that the energy is restricted to certain values, rather than being able to take on any value. Three different kinds of motion can occur: **translation** (motion through space), **rotation** (change of orientation), and **vibration** (the periodic stretching and bending of bonds).

The link between the energies of individual molecules and the energy of bulk matter is provided by one of the most important concepts in chemistry, the **Boltzmann distribution** Bulk matter consists of large numbers of molecules, each of which is in one of its available energy states. The total number of molecules with a particular energy due to translation, rotation, vibration, and its electronic state is called the **‘population’** of that state. Most molecules are found in the lowest energy state, and higher states are occupied by progressively fewer molecules. The Boltzmann distribution gives the population, $N_{i}$ of any energy state in terms of the energy of the state, εi, and the absolute temperature, $T$:
$$N_{i} \propto e^{-ε_{i}/kT}$$
According to the Boltzmann distribution, the temperature is the single parameter that governs the spread of populations over the available energy states, whatever their nature.

The Boltzmann distribution, as well as providing insight into the significance of temperature, is central to understanding much of chemistry. That most molecules occupy states of low energy when the temperature is low accounts for the existence of compounds and the persistence of liquids and solids. That highly excited energy levels become accessible at high temperatures accounts for the possibility of reaction as one substance acquires the ability to change into another.
